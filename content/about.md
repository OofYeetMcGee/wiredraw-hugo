Jared Henderson is an innovative entrepreneur who has always had an eye for identifying inefficiencies and turning them into opportunities for improvement. His journey in the world of information management began in an unexpected place: a steel detailing company.
Early in his career, Jared joined a steel detailing company and quickly realized that the existing information management practices were far from ideal. Timecards were managed using cumbersome Excel spreadsheets, crucial Requests for Information (RFIs) were prone to getting lost in a sea of emails, and everyday operations were bogged down by the lack of an effective system. It was clear that there had to be a better way.

Jared's passion for efficiency and problem-solving kicked into high gear. Recognizing the need for a streamlined information management system, he embarked on a mission to create a solution that would not only solve their internal challenges but also set a new standard for information management in their industry.

His approach was methodical, using an iterative process of trial and error. Jared and his team tirelessly refined their system, learning from each iteration and adapting it to meet the company's unique needs. Over time, the system evolved into something that was not only efficient but also intuitive, making it easier for every member of the team to manage information effectively.

What sets Jared apart is his unwavering commitment to effectiveness. He understands that in today's fast-paced business world, wasted time and lost opportunities can be costly. His dedication to creating an information management system that was not just good but exceptional has been the driving force behind his success.

Today, Jared Henderson's journey serves as an inspiration to all those who strive for innovation and excellence in information management. His story is a testament to the power of determination, innovation, and the ability to turn challenges into opportunities.

Jared's vision and dedication have not only transformed his own company's operations but have also laid the foundation for Wiredraw, where he continues to create custom information management systems that empower businesses to thrive. With Jared's leadership, Wiredraw is setting new standards for efficiency and effectiveness, one solution at a time.
